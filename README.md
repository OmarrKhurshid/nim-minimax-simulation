# Game of Nim Simulation using Minimax Algorithm

The Game of Nim is a two-player game where each player takes turns removing objects from a set of piles. The player who removes the last object wins the game. This project simulates the Game of Nim using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Installation

To run this game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). It's recommended to use virtual environments for better isolation.

## How to Run

This project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook. To run the simulation, open the 'Game_of_Nim_Simulation.ipynb' file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and execute the cells sequentially. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to interact with the game.
